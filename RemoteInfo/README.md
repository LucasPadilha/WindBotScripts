You can remotely get information about your character and/or your bot status (like profit/waste).
Simply PM your character with any command (which you can modify to any word) and the bot will PM you back with the information you want.


#####Currently it does have 3 commands: !Info, !supply, !profit.


The *!info* command will PM your character's level, balance, stamina, played time, exp/h and time to next level.

The *!supply* command will PM how much of each supply item has been used.

The *!profit* command will PM the current profit/waste of your hunt.

Set up the safe list with the names of your characters and the words to the commands.
